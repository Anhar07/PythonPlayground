Learning Python

This is wheere I will practice and learn.

The website I am using to learn is https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html 

I finally learned how to use the basics of Github on cmd, 
Im really happy by this hehe

.....
Day 3
Its really fun solving problems on my own.
I had another problem where I couldnt build input(),
then realized sublime text did not support it. So i
installed the SublimeREPL, it works really well :D!! 

Day 4
Hahah I did something dumb and accidentally erased
the PATH for git. In the end I reinstalled git 
to reset my path.

While learning "for loop" and using "for i in range()"
I seriously wish someone told me earlier "i" can be any letter 
as long as your consistent. It makes it less complicated to understand.
Haha, self discovery is so much better. I'm having fun hehe.
