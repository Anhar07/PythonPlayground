Learning Python

This is wheere I will practice and learn.

The website I am using to learn is https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html 

I finally learned how to use the basics of Github on cmd, 
Im really happy by this hehe

Day 3
Its really fun solving problems on my own. 

Day 4
Hahah I did something dumb and accidentally erased
the PATH for git. In the end I reinstalled git 
to reset my path.
