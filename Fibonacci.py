# Fibonacci Series: The sum of two elements defines the next
a, b = 0, 1		#Defining variables a and b
while b < 10:	#While loop, the indention shows what is insdife of the loop
	print(b)	
	a, b = b, a+b
#Basically a = b, 1 = 1: 
#b is a +b so, 1 + 1
#
	


#in C and python 0 is false, everything else is true
