# PythonPlayground
My work area for learning Python.

I'll be learning from this website: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html 

Each Day I'll write about my thoughts, challenges and etc. It's the same as Daily Etries.  

My goal is to code everyday :). 


DAY 2

 I finally learned how to use the basics of Github on cmd, Im really happy by this hehe

DAY 3

Its really fun solving problems on my own.
I had another problem where I couldnt build input(),
then realized sublime text did not support it. So I installed the SublimeREPL, it works really well :D!! 

DAY 4

Hahah I did something dumb and accidentally erased
the PATH for git. In the end I reinstalled git 
to reset my path.

While learning "for loop" and using "for i in range()"
I seriously wish someone told me earlier "i" can be any letter 

I don't understand what "minimal class" means
as long as your consistent. It makes it less complicated to understand.
Haha, self discovery is so much better. I'm having fun hehe.


DAY 5

I've been stuck on the same problem since yesterday. I ussually build my Python code on Sublime Text 3, but for some reason it is giving me 

"'py' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
[Finished in 0.2s with exit code 1]."

It was working perfectly, I shut down my laptop then turned it back on. Now it won't work. AHHhhh I have until friday to fix this. Omygosh, please be fixed by today.
